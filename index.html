        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Rashid Ibrahim, 
            a senior Computer Science student at the University of Washington Bothell. 
            With a strong academic background and a deep passion for programming, 
            I have acquired knowledge and experience in various areas of computer science.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently excelled in my coursework, 
            earning a high GPA and recognition on the Dean's List. My studies have provided me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, C++, and SQL. 
            I have also gained expertise in data structures and algorithms, software engineering, and database systems.</p>
        <p>As part of my capstone project, I am excited to share my expertise in solving challenging LeetCode questions. 
            One specific problem that I will guide you through is LeetCode question 297: Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree.
            By exploring this problem together, we will uncover efficient solutions and unravel the complexities of binary tree serialization and deserialization.</p>
        <p>Thank you for joining me on this exciting exploration of the hard LeetCode question 297: 
            Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree.</p>
