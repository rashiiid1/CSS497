        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Rashid Ibrahim, 
            a senior Computer Science student at the University of Washington Bothell. 
            With a strong academic background and a deep passion for programming, 
            I have acquired knowledge and experience in various areas of computer science.</p>
        <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently excelled in my coursework, 
            earning a high GPA and recognition on the Dean's List. My studies have provided me with a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, C++, and SQL. 
            I have also gained expertise in data structures and algorithms, software engineering, and database systems.</p>
        <p>As part of my capstone project, I am excited to share my expertise in solving challenging LeetCode questions. 
            One specific problem that I will guide you through is LeetCode question 297: Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree.
            By exploring this problem together, we will uncover efficient solutions and unravel the complexities of binary tree serialization and deserialization.</p>
        <p>Thank you for joining me on this exciting exploration of the hard LeetCode question 297: 
            Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement: Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree</h2>
        <p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.</p>
        <p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>
        <p>Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.</p>
        <h3>Example 1:</h3>
        <pre>
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
        </pre>
        <h3>Example 2:</h3>
        <pre>
Input: root = []
Output: []
        </pre>
        <h3>Constraints:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].</li>
            <li>-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000</li>
        </ul>
