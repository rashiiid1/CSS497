    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.</p>
        <p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Clarification:</strong> The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p><strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]</p>
        <p><strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]</p>

        <h2>Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10<sup>4</sup>].</li>
            <li>-1000 ≤ Node.val ≤ 1000</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
